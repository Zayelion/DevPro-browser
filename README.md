#Overview
This project contains a number of developmental projects that test and attempt to bring YGOPro to the web browser under the DevPro name. The main feature is an web intergration with DevPro's flagship launcher software. The feature connects to DevPro's proprietary server software via an NodeJS proxy bridge which is for developmental resons hung client side, for production and later testing it will be hung server side. The second feature is an immatation of line by line breakdown of the OCGAPI using ASMJS methods to create an array that acts as virtual memory. Later illiterations may use Emscripten or other ASM.js based programming patterns.
